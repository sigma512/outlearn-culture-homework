# Create an Outlearn Account

You need to [create an Outlearn account](https://pilot.outlearn.com/auth/join) to save any of your progress on the platform. If you want to have one less password to keep track of or if you think you may want to publish something yourself, you can join with your GitHub account. Click "Join With GitHub" so that Outlearn can access and publish your content. GitHub will ask for your permission using a popup like the one below.

# Anatomy of a Path

Learning Paths are core to the Outlearn experience. Each of them has an outline page where you can get a quick overview of what's inside the Path. As an example, check out the [outline for this Path](https://pilot.outlearn.com/learn/outlearn/start-learning). You can see a screenshot below.

![Outline page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/outlearn-content/outlearn-publishing/master/images/outline.png)

Paths are made up of Modules and Context Pages (or just "Pages"). Modules provide good stand-alone learning value and they can be reused effectively in many Paths. Pages are the glue that holds the Modules together. Pages are specific to a Path and often tell you why the author you chose the Modules they did, how they fit together, what parts are super important, etc.

On the Path outline page, Pages are shown with their title and Modules also list some metadata as well as all the Sections inside the Module. You can click on any Page or Module to jump right in. Feel free to also check out the profile pages of the authors to see what other brilliant stuff they have published.

# Navigating a Path

There are a few different ways to move around a Path. You can move to the previous or next page with the semi-transparent buttons on the sides of the screen. Note that they disappear if you make the browser window narrow. And because keyboard shortcuts are awesome, you can also use `l` or right arrow move forward and `h` or left arrow to go back. To see all the keyboard shortcuts, click on the gear icon at the lower left-hand corner.

The top of the page shows a navigation bar that summarizes the whole Path. The outline page is a circle at the left. Each Page is represented by a dot and each Module by a bar. You can click on any dot or bar to move around.

Each Module is made up of one or more Sections and they are listed on the right side of the page. You can click on the Sections titles to move around. Keyboard shortcuts for next and previous Section are `n` and `p` respectively. Your current Section is expanded in the nav bar with each Section shown separately and completed Sections highlighted. Below you can see a sample nav bar.

# Tracking Your Progress

Outlearn makes it super easy for individual developers and teams to track their learning progress. Each Section has a check box that you can check either at the end of the Section or from the list of Sections on the right. It's up to you to decide when you are "done" with a Section. Outlearn is built for professional developers and you know best whether you want to spend more time on a topic or move on.

Most Modules also have tasks with checkboxes. Those are the things that the author thinks are most valuable for you to do. Some tasks also have a deliverable where you need to paste in some text to complete the task. If you want to see at a glance how you are doing with a path and what you submitted as deliverables, navigate to [My Learning](https://pilot.outlearn.com/my-learning) and choose the Path you want to see. If you are learning a Path together with you organization, the person with admin rights for the organizations Outlearn account can also see your progress and submissions. Below is an example Progress Report for this path.

# Your Profile and Settings

You can use the icon at the top right hand corner to edit your profile and settings. Go to Profile and choose Edit Profile to change your name, email, and social links, as well as to choose a profile picture. If you belong to any organizations on Outlearn or have published any Paths, you can see those on your profile page too. Go to [Settings](https://pilot.outlearn.com/settings) to change your password. If you have not already linked your GitHub account with Outlearn, you can do that here too.

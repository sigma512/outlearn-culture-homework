# About the Deck

Netflix was a classic disruptor company that redefined how people are entertained by long form video content. Reid Hoffman, their maverick CEO, has done a fantastic job of defining a culture that has helped them attract and manage great people through early exploration, market fit, strategy changes, big crises, and incredible growth. This deck is a classic.

# What's This Deck?
Netflix was a classic disruptor company that redefined how people are entertained by long form video content. Reid Hoffman, their maverick CEO, put together this culture deck to capture what he believes makes Netflix special. He believes that these values and principles have helped them succeed through strategy changes, big crises, and big growth. As you review the deck, think critically about what you like/dislike, what you think is most relevant to Outlearn, and what may be missing.

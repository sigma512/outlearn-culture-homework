# On Culture
We are passionate about building a strong culture at Outlearn. We have been fortunate to be part of organizations with strong cultures that have served their organizations well. We have seen how culture can attract the best colleagues, build super valuable brands, help companies get things done, provide vital clarity in tough times. We have also seen how culture forms with or without guidance, and we've seen how hard it can be to change culture after the momentum is essablished.

Simply put, companies with great cultures are more fun and deliver massively better results than companies with not-so-great cultures. So we are not going to leave the Outlearn culture to chance. It is time to come together as a seed team and defin the foundation of the Outlearn.

## Why Now?
As a seed stage company, defining our culture has taken a back seat to building the product and finding product market fit. But we believe that now is a perfect time to iterative process of writing down our culture. We have been working together for many months, and we have successfully weathered ups and downs together. We are contemplating our next round of fundraising and preparing for the wave of hiring that will come after that. Defining our culture will help us attract and develop the best people. It will also help us define ourselves more clearly for the marketplace and for our future investors. It's just time.

## This Path
In this path we have curated a set of readings on culture that we need everyone in the company to be familiar with. We don't endorse everything that these authors say, but overall, we think they are on the right track and we hope to incorporate many of these ideas into the Outlearn culture. Please dedicate sufficient time to be able to really ponder and absorb the material, but as you contemplate what our culture should be, you need not restrict yourself to ideas capture in these readings. At the end of the path, you will have an opportunity to express your opinions on what our core values should be.
